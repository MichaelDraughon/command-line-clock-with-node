<p>This clock is really inefficient with CPU usage, please don't let it run for days ar a time unless you are trying to heat up your room for winter</p>

<p>Other than that, though, it looks cool, and also if you want to change the color, you can. Simply go to the clock directory and open up "main.js" in your favorite text editor, and then change the line of code on line 46. It is the chalk.red part you want to edit,you can cange the color to red, green, yellow, blue, cyan, magenta, white, grey, or bgBlack (looks like grey).</p>
